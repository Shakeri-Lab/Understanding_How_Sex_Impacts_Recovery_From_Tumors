StageRuleHit,Description
CUT1,This rule applies when PathGroupStage contains IV and assigns stage IV for cutaneous melanoma.
CUT2,This rule applies when ClinGroupStage contains IV while PathGroupStage is unknown or inapplicable and assigns stage IV for cutaneous melanoma.
CUT3,This rule applies to a metastatic specimen collected from a site that is not skin| lymph node| soft tissue| muscle| parotid| chest wall| head| or scalp and assigns stage IV for cutaneous melanoma.
CUT4,This rule applies to a lymph-node specimen when regional or Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) nodal spread from a cutaneous primary tumor was present at or before specimen collection| and thus the value of field PathGroupStage is III| and assigns stage III.
CUT5,This rule applies to a lymph-node specimen representing regional nodal recurrence in a patient| with a value of PathGroup stage not equal to III or IV| a value of ClinGroupStage not equal to IV| and no distant nodal metastases at or before specimen collection| and assigns stage III.
CUT6,This rule applies to a lymph-node specimen that represents a distant nodal recurrence and whose value of PathGroupStage is not IV and assigns stage IV.
CUT7,This rule applies to a parotid specimen that represents distant recurrence and assigns stage IV.
CUT8,This rule applies to a parotid specimen with regional or NOS nodal disease and assigns stage III.
CUT9,This rule applies to a metastatic cutaneous or soft-tissue specimen associated with distant or NOS metastasis that occurred before specimen collection and assigns stage IV.
CUT10,This rule applies to a metastatic cutaneous or soft-tissue specimen associated with regional or NOS metastasis and assigns stage III.
CUT11,This rule applies to a primary cutaneous specimen collected at or after distant metastasis and assigns stage IV.
CUT12P,This fallback rule uses the numeric stage recorded in PathGroupStage for cutaneous melanoma and yields stage I| II| or III| since CUT1 would have been applied if PathGroupStage contained IV.
CUT12C,This fallback rule uses the numeric stage recorded in ClinGroupStage when PathGroupStage lacks a numerical stage for cutaneous melanoma and yields stage I| II| or III| since CUT2 would have been applied if ClinGroupStage contained IV and PathGroupStage lacks a numerical stage for cutaneous melanoma.
CUT-UNK,This placeholder indicates that no cutaneous staging rule could be applied.
OC1,This rule applies when PathGroupStage contains IV and assigns stage IV for ocular melanoma.
OC2,This rule applies when ClinGroupStage contains IV while PathGroupStage is unknown or inapplicable and assigns stage IV for ocular melanoma.
OC3,This rule triggers when distant metastases are documented at or before specimen collection and assigns stage IV for ocular melanoma.
OC4,This rule applies to a lymph-node specimen of ocular origin with regional or NOS recurrence and no distant metastasis and assigns stage III.
OC-UNK,This placeholder indicates that no ocular staging rule could be applied.
MU1,This rule applies when PathGroupStage contains IV and assigns stage IV for mucosal melanoma.
MU2,This rule applies when ClinGroupStage contains IV while PathGroupStage is unknown or inapplicable and assigns stage IV for mucosal melanoma.
MU3P,This rule applies to a primary mucosal specimen if PathGroupStage contains I| II| or III and assigns the numeric stage I| II| or III from PathGroupStage.
MU3C,This rule applies to a primary mucosal specimen when PathGroupStage lacks a numerical stage and assigns the numeric stage I| II| or III from ClinGroupStage.
MU3M,This rule applies to a metastatic mucosal specimen with no evidence of past| present| or future distant metastases and with a value of PathGroupStage not equal to IV and assigns stage III.
MU4,This rule applies when distant metastases are present in mucosal melanoma and assigns stage IV.
MU-UNK,This placeholder indicates that no mucosal staging rule could be applied.
UN1,This rule applies when PathGroupStage contains IV and assigns stage IV for melanoma with an unknown primary tumor.
UN2,This rule applies when ClinGroupStage contains IV while PathGroupStage is unknown or inapplicable and assigns stage IV for melanoma with an unknown primary tumor.
UN3P,This rule assigns the numeric stage I| II| or III from PathGroupStage for melanoma with an unknown primary tumor.
UN3C,This rule assigns the numeric stage I| II| or III from ClinGroupStage when PathGroupStage lacks a numerical stage for melanoma with an unknown primary tumor.
UN-UNK,This placeholder indicates that no staging rule could be applied for melanoma with an unknown primary tumor.
